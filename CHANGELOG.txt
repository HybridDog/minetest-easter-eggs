v. 0.1
-----------------------
- Split 'sugar overdose' effect into a two phase process: first the speedup effect takes place and then the damage is dealt.
- Updated README.md file.
- Added support for Wuzzy's hbhunger mod.
- Replaced indexing by entire player table with player's name for so_affected_players[]: possibly slight improvement in memory management.
